Error in rule reads_unzip:
    jobid: 0
    output: raw_data/reads/reads-3.fastq
    shell:
        bzip2 -vcfdk readsPrimary_polyp_AZK_3_ATTCCTTT_L002_R1_001.fastq.bz2 > raw_data/reads/reads-3.fastq
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job reads_unzip since they might be corrupted:
raw_data/reads/reads-3.fastq
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
